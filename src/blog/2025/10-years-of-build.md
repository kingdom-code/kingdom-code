Tickets for [Kingdom Code BUILD 2025](/build/2025) are now on sale! This year marks our 10th anniversary, and we're back at St. John's Hoxton on 10–11 October 2025.

We're partnering with [FaithTech](https://faithtech.com/) this year – a global community working to see a Jesus revival awakened in and through tech. Together, we're creating space for Christian technologists to tackle real challenges facing ministries and organisations across the UK and beyond.

## What's BUILD All About?

Whether you spend your day debugging code, designing user experiences that serve millions, or managing teams building the next big thing – your work matters to God. BUILD is where we step back from our day jobs and ask: what would it look like to intentionally apply our gifts to serve Christian ministries and communities?

We gather on Friday evening, form teams around projects with problems that need solving, and then spend the next 24 hours building something with real kingdom impact. Whether you code, design, manage projects, or think strategically – there's space for your skills.

Past teams have built everything from live translation tools for church services to interactive advent calendars that explore the Christmas story, as well as solving problems like back-of-house admin for foodbanks, and how to track virtual sponsored events for charity fundraising. Every year, teams at BUILD make a difference by tackling real challenges facing gospel-led organisations.

## Why People Keep Coming Back

> *The energy is infectious. You walk in on Friday not knowing anyone, and by the end you've built lasting friendships and something that actually matters.*

– Sarah, attending her fourth BUILD

> *I love the multi-disciplinary diversity amongst the teams…- it’s a fantastic opportunity for kingdom-minded technical experts to put their skills to good use to build God's kingdom*

– Matt, first timer at BUILD 24.

> *BUILD reminded me why I got into tech in the first place – to solve problems and help people.*

– Rachel, product designer

So that's it – 24 hours, integrating faith and tech, great people, meaningful projects. [Book your place](/build/2025/#tickets) and we'll see you in October.

Each year we look for [project submissions](/build/projects/) from ministries who could use some tech help, [plus sponsors](/build/partnership/) to make this year even better. Know someone who might be interested? Drop us a line!
