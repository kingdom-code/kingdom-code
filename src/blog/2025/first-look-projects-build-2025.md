At [Kingdom Code BUILD](https://kingdomcode.org.uk/build/2025), we gather for 24 hours to use our technical skills in service of the gospel — building tools, solving problems, and pushing forward projects that matter. This year’s hackathon takes place 10–11 October 2025, and we want to give you a first look at some of the projects that will be worked on during the weekend.

These projects are coming from Christian ministries across the UK and beyond, and they’re looking for developers, designers, strategists, and more to help move them forward.

## Expanding the Translation – Breeze Translate

Help Breeze Translate triple its language reach and empower churches around the world by upgrading its transcription engine for faster, broader, and more inclusive translation.

Breeze Translate is already breaking down language barriers in church services, but there's a vision to do more. With the right updates to their tech stack, they could unlock dozens of new input languages — enabling people not only to hear the gospel, but to share their own stories of faith in their heart language.

## Family Journey Copilot – Safe Families UK

Build an AI-powered tool to help caseworkers quickly and compassionately understand a family’s story — bringing clarity, continuity, and care to every handover.

Safe Families supports over a thousand families each year. As case histories grow, so does the challenge of understanding them. This project aims to build a secure AI-powered summary tool, helping family support workers see the bigger picture quickly and act with confidence and care.

## The Serpent & The Seed – Discipleship Tech

Bring a Bible-based mobile game to desktop by adding controller support, Steam features, and multilingual access for players around the world.

The Serpent & The Seed is a stunning mobile game exploring the story of the Bible — and now the team needs help to bring it to a new audience on desktop. There’s controller input to handle, achievements to add, and localised versions to begin — and lots of room for creative input.
