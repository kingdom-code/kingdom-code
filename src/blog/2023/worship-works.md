How often do you think about your work as an act of worship and something to bring to God in prayer?

> May the favour of the Lord our God rest upon us; establish the work of our hands for us — yes, establish the work of our hands (Psalm 90:17)

## Worship.Works

One of the core ideas behind Kingdom Code, and the annual hackathon BUILD, is to help us explore what that might look like as we put hand-to-keyboard in the world of technology. Today we're pleased to announce that Worship.Works have come on board to partner with us to put on BUILD 2023; here's a little bit from Daniel at [Worship.Works](https://worship.works/worship-works-x-build/):

> We're really proud to be supporting BUILD 2023 as we share a common vision with Kingdom Code to see Christians embrace the work they do as a way of serving God to build His Kingdom here on earth in every sphere of society.
>
> We believe that the skills, talents and abilities God has given us are not solely for the purpose of earning an income, but ultimately He wants us to use them to glorify Jesus and bring Kingdom change to the spaces and places He leads us into. God wants to reach the world with the incredibly good news of Christ and His Kingdom, and He chooses to do that through us in the workplaces and industries we are part of!

Worship.Works exists to equip and support Christians as they serve God through their work - we invite you to find out more at [worship.works/worship-works-x-build](https://worship.works/worship-works-x-build).

## Discounted tickets

Earlier this week we also sold our last early-bird ticket. Numbers were limited, and now they have all gone. Regular BUILD tickets are onsale until Wednesday 11th October (or until all 80 places are booked up). _However_, we know that money may be tight at the moment, so we are glad that we have another supporter who has generously agreed to discount a number of tickets for those who would like to attend but for whom the ticket price is a barrier.

For more details please see the [BUILD 2023 Discount Request Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc8oMJLSMH9icdjsmZgnEryHiPr0uJObD6H49XCb0jB73bJQw/viewform).

## Coming soon…

Keep your eyes out next week for announcements for the first set of projects coming to BUILD.
