**“How can we equip Christians to use the Bible more in evangelism?” That was the challenge Christianity Explored Ministries posed to a group of tech enthusiasts at the Kingdom Code BUILD event earlier this week.**

Kingdom Code gathers together Christians who have a passion for using digital technology and design. Each year they host a 24-hour ‘hackathon’ event to
kick start projects that integrate the Christian faith and the skills of those attending.

CEM is one of two ministries involved with this year’s hackathon, challenging these innovators to develop creative ideas to address a big need in the church today.

## “Alive and active”

The church is facing a crisis in confidence in the word of God. We’re not sure people will want to read the Bible, and we’re not convinced it will do them much good if they do.

But if we are ever tempted to think that the Bible is dead and passive, the writer to the Hebrews corrects our thinking: “The word of God is alive and active, sharper than any double-edged sword” (Hebrews 4:12).

Because the word of God is alive and active, the best way for people to discover the good news of Jesus is by opening the Bible together so they can hear the voice of Jesus.

If Christian believers have access to a Bible, they have the best possible evangelistic resource available. And now, because of developments in digital technology, we have new opportunities to use the Bible in our personal evangelism.

## Creative proposals

The BUILD event this week was an initial ‘design sprint.’ This was an intensive evening where we posed our challenge to the innovators: “How can we equip Christians to use the Bible more in evangelism?”. We then worked with them in smaller groups as they made proposals for resources that could be developed to help.

It was a real encouragement to see a diverse group of Christians, many of whom have never met one another, coming together to use the gifts God has given them in creative ways to advance his Kingdom.

## Get hacking!

This week’s design sprint was building towards the main BUILD event next month.

The ‘hackathon’ is a bigger gathering where teams have 24 hours to work together to develop creative solutions to the ‘challenge’ we have posed. By the end of the event we expect to see new resources that will help Christians to look at the Bible with unbelievers.

Everyone is welcome to take part - you don’t need to be able to write a line of code! Developers, designers, project managers, branding experts, and everyone else besides will have something to contribute.

Why not join us and contribute your skills as we seek to develop new tools for equipping Christians to use the Bible in their personal evangelism?

The Kingdom Code BUILD event runs from 18:00 on Friday 11th to 21:00 on Saturday 12th October at St John’s Hoxton in North London.
