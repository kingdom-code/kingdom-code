**In September we've got two meetups happening ahead of [BUILD](/build), the annual Kingdom Code hackathon. This month we're going to be getting practical in workshops happening in [London](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/build-design-sprint-tickets-66341323685) and [Leeds](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/kingdom-code-leeds-design-sprint-tickets-68449300701).** Over the course of the evening together we're going to be working our way through a condensed Design Sprint… ideating, prototyping, testing and presenting together.

Have you or your team ever thought about a new project or feature, but haven't really been sure how to go about it? Design Sprints create a way to rapidly prototype ideas before making a heavy investment in development time. They are also fun to do as a team too!

Okay… so why is this a Kingdom Code event? Good question! Well, ahead of [BUILD](/build) we are inviting [our challenge partners](/blog/2019/build-hackathon-partners/) to share more of what they are working on, exploring more about the challenges and using a Design Sprint to prototype and test your ideas.

If you are joining us at BUILD, want to explore Design Sprints or just want to meet other Christians in the world of the Design Sprint meet ups will be a great place to be!

Book your place:

- [London on Monday 9th September](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/build-design-sprint-tickets-66341323685)
- [Leeds on Thursday 26th September](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/kingdom-code-leeds-design-sprint-tickets-68449300701)
