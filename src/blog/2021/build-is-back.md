It’s been a long time since you heard from us. You might have even forgotten what Kingdom Code is! Let me remind you; Kingdom Code is a community of Christians who work in the world of technology and innovation. We’re a group which explores together how our faith shapes how and what we design, build, and use.

And we’ve been quiet for a while, however as the UK begins to open up again we’ve been making plans to relaunch -

**[Kingdom Code BUILD](/build) will be back this autumn. Get your calendars out and save these dates; Friday 15th - Saturday 16th October 2021.**

BUILD is our annual hackathon run in partnership with [Indigitous](https://indigitous.org/). At the heart of the weekend is a desire to bring the Kingdom Code community together for a weekend to build friendships, and to grow and use our tech skills to serve different ministries with ideas, prototypes, and products.

The event will look different this year; for a start we’re going to be hosting the hackathon in two locations; one in Leeds, and one in London, which should make it easier for those in the North to get to. We’ll be changing up the kind of projects that we work on, and also launching our new community groups.

There will be more news and updates in the coming months, with details about the hackathon challenges, venue locations, and importantly booking information! But for now, please save the date - Kingdom Code BUILD: Friday 15th - Saturday 16th October 2021.
