Serendipity
_sɛr(ə)nˈdɪpɪti/_
noun: The occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way.

At Kingdom Code, we meet regularly to forge divine serendipity within the tech space. We believe that God has a passion for Excellence and Design – Together. Jesus created us with precision. One of the most attractive aspects of technology is the minute precision it attracts for getting things done. How much more amazing is this precision when it is channelled into the work of God?

> ‘Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;’ Hebrews 3:1

Another aspect of technology is its capacity to reach many people with messages which allows them to make transactions and receive offers from anywhere they are. This flexible tool is something that is crucial for the Kingdom of God, with the coordination of high tech products into churches being inextricably linked with Christian technology entrepreneurs.

How does that look like in reality?

Before Christmas we met in a cosy cafeteria as a group of developers, UX/UI designers, data geeks, product managers and entrepreneurs to swap ideas about what could be the London edition of a Hackathon for the Kingdom. As any geek-gathering, our meeting was fuelled by pizza, exciting ideas and speakers.

We were delighted by the presence of Chris Armas, Director of Emerging Initiatives for Leadership Network and the primary organiser of Code for the Kingdom.

Chris presented his goal of implementing a self-sustaining ecosystem of faith-based hackathons around the world to tackle global issues “with a Christian perspective”, although non-Christians are also welcome.

Examples of ‘Code for the Kingdom’ that took place in March in the Dallas included apps to fight human trafficking , apps to help children build and play crossword puzzles out of Bible verses and others to streamline the connection between homeless people and social services. These projects are an encouraging testimony that there is a space in tech to hack for Christ.

Chris led us in an exciting brainstorming session around the possibility of innovative non-profit solutions with causes that engage people and how to ignite an entrepreneurial community in London. We were also challenged with the need to forge a network of Kingdom minded investors and donors, with the non monetary support from churches who would be a catalyst to open the market.

What’s next?

Our Hackathon is planned for 2-4 October 2015, be part of this exciting event!
