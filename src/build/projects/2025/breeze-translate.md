Breeze Translate has already helped churches break language barriers, but there’s still more to do. Right now, their system depends on a transcription engine that limits the number of languages available. That means some members of the global church family still can’t fully engage.

They’ve identified a promising new transcription service that could triple the number of input languages, offer auto-language detection, and even enable contextual transcriptions. It’s a chance to move from just translation to full participation — where someone can even share their testimony in their own language.

At BUILD, the team would love to explore replacing their current transcription engine with a more flexible architecture that could allow adding in different tools. There’s work to do on both the front and back end — and it’s a great opportunity to push the project to the next level.

The impact? Breeze Translate has already grown 10x since the last BUILD, and with your help, they’re aiming to do it again before next year.
