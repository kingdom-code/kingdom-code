The Serpent & The Seed is a beautifully crafted mobile game that invites players, even those who wouldn’t call themselves Christians, into the big story of the Bible. Since launching in April, thousands have played, and the response has been deeply encouraging.

Now, the team wants to take the next step: bringing the game to desktop. That means reimagining how players interact with the experience, and it opens up a whole set of challenges and creative opportunities.

At BUILD, you could help tackle one (or more!) of the following:

- Adding controller support for a range of mini-games originally designed for touch
- Integrating Steam achievements and cloud-synced saves
- Beginning the process of localisation; not just swapping text, but navigating the unique ways “words” appear in the game world

This isn’t a one-off project, The Serpent & The Seed is a long-term investment for Discipleship Tech. What you build during the hackathon will become part of something much bigger, helping the game reach more players, in more places, with a story that has changed lives for generations.

- **Skills needed:** Game development (Unity, C#), Design, UI/UX, Experience with controller input or localisation is a plus
- **Tech stack:** Unity, C#
