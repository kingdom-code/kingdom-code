Safe Families UK walks alongside families facing complex, often long-term challenges. Over time, case records grow into a deep well of notes — referral forms, support plans, reviews, observations — all stored in their MySQL-based system. But when a Family Support Manager (FSM) changes, picking up that story quickly and compassionately is hard. Important context can get lost in the detail.

That’s where the Family Journey Copilot comes in: an AI-powered summarisation tool that gives FSMs a clear, concise, and sensitive overview of a family’s journey so far — helping them pick up the story with care and insight.

At BUILD, the Safe Families is looking for help to create a working prototype that:

- Pulls data from anonymised family cases in a MySQL database (mock records during the hackthon)
- Processes and summarises it using GPT-4 via Azure OpenAI
- Displays the results in a lightweight frontend panel for live demo

This tool will help the Family Support Managers during handover time — it will honour their work and the families they serve, reducing handover friction and ensuring no key detail gets missed. Longer-term, it could also support impact reporting and grant applications by generating case studies in natural language.

 - **Skills needed:** Backend (Python/FastAPI or Flask), AI integration, Frontend (HTML/PHP), Data handling
 - **Tech stack:** MySQL, Python, Azure OpenAI (GPT-4), PHP-based frontend
