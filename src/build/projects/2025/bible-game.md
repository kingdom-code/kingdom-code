summary: Level up a daily Bible guessing game that helps Christians visualise Scripture's structure through a star-map interface, building mental maps of where books and events sit in the grand narrative.

Daily word games like Wordle and geography games like Globle do something interesting: through repetition and play, they help you build spatial understanding. You start to visualize where countries are on the map or how words are structured. Many Christians lack that same intuitive sense of where books sit in the Bible and how events connect across Scripture.

Bible Game brings that same daily guessing-game mechanic to Scripture with a unique twist: the Bible is displayed as a star-map that helps you visualize where books and events live in relation to each other. Each day, a random Bible chapter is summarized in a short sentence. You guess by clicking the map or using dropdowns, receiving nudges with each incorrect attemptâ€”a before/after arrow and the number of verses away. Parts of the map outside correctly guessed sections grey out to focus your search. You have five attempts before the answer is revealed. As you play, you build a mental map of how the grand narrative unfolds.

The app has been developing over the past year and now has users at the creator's local church. It's publicly available but still in early stages, with significant potential to grow.

At BUILD, the team wants to take Bible Game to the next level, exploring:

- Enhancing the user experience and game mechanics for daily Bible practice
- Improving the AI integration for summaries, questions, and passage contexts
- Building feedback systems where users can train the game's understanding of Scripture
- Adding features that encourage reading the day's passage and track coverage across Scripture
- Developing social elements like shared results and leaderboards

There's an interesting longer-term vision here too; creating a system where user feedback helps train AI to understand Biblical principles more deeply, contributing to the broader conversation about missional AI.

This project sits at the intersection of gamification, Scripture engagement, and emerging technology. It's about making Bible structure memorable through play while building something that could influence how AI understands Scripture.
