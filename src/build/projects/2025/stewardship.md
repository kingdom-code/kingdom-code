summary: Create a space for personal reflection where givers can engage meaningfully with their own journey of generosity, helping them rediscover the joy and purpose behind their giving.
year: 2025
---


At Stewardship, they believe generosity grows when givers can connect meaningfully with their own journey of stewardship. Right now, many donors feel disconnected from their giving â€” they know the transactions, but struggle to see the deeper story their generosity tells about their faith and calling.

What if givers could reflect on questions like: 'is my giving aligned with what God is calling me to?' or 'what story is my generosity telling?' Instead of just showing donation history, Stewardship wants to create a space for personal reflection that helps people rediscover the joy and purpose behind their giving.

At BUILD, they want to explore how their existing data can become a tool for spiritual reflection rather than just transaction tracking.

The team is looking to:
* Explore what data they already hold on givers and how it could be used
* Identify additional data that could enrich the reflective experience
* Prototype ways to present giving patterns back to users with personalised insights and reflective prompts

This project is about encouraging faithful and joyful generosity rooted in the heart of discipleship. After BUILD, this prototype will become a core feature across Stewardship's platforms, helping thousands of givers grow in generous discipleship.

* **Skills needed:** Design, Development, Content/Writing, Project Management
* **Tech stack:** SQL database, Power BI, React Native, jQuery (but open to working with available skillsets for the prototype)
