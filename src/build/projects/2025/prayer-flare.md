Thousands of Christians work in businesses too small to have workplace fellowship groups. They commute away from their church communities each day into environments where they're the only believer, spending the majority of their time isolated from the body of Christ.

By linking up Christians in similar work situations or locations, the project aims to create new opportunities for prayer, encouragement, and fellowship during the working week.

Users would register their rough location, work schedule, and availability for prayer or fellowship. The platform would then identify potential matches based on proximity or timing, connecting people who might meet for lunch, pray together before work, or simply know there's another believer nearby.

At BUILD, the team wants to prototype the core functionality and explore how such a service might work in practice. This could include:

- Building a basic matching algorithm that connects Christians by location and availability
- Creating user profiles that capture work patterns, prayer needs, and fellowship preferences
- Prototyping a messaging system to facilitate initial connections
- Designing the user experience for registration and match discovery
- Exploring privacy and safety considerations for a location-based service

The hackathon will focus on creating the foundation for a website, and developing initial the matching logic. This project offers the chance to tackle both technical challenges and explore the heart behind Christian community in the modern workplace. How do we help isolated believers find each other? The goal is to validate the concept and build something that could launch as a pilot in one geographical area.
