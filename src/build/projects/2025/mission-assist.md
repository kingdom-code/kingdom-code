In the church, we often talk about Bible literacy without considering literacy itself. Mission Assist recognized that many people struggle to understand the Bible not because of its spiritual depth, but because of the English language barrier. Their solution; a Bible paraphrase using only 1,200 common English words, making Scripture accessible to English learners and non-native speakers around the world.

Now they want to take the next step. Alongside providing accessible text, Mission Assist wants to create a tool that guides people through their first journey with the Bible. The concept is beautifully simple: read or listen to a chapter, highlight a verse that speaks to you, then write or record your thoughts about what stood out.

At BUILD, the challenge is making this experience work for people who aren't digital natives. The tool needs intuitive navigation, engaging design, and rewarding interactions that bring people back day after day. How do you create a Bible reading experience that feels encouraging rather than overwhelming?

The team will build on Mission Assist's existing WordPress platform, prototyping the user experience and core functionality. If successful, these patterns will be adapted for their Android app, reaching even more people who are taking their first steps into Scripture.

This project sits at the intersection of accessibility, discipleship, and user experience design. It's about removing barriers and creating pathways for people to encounter God's word in their own language journey.
