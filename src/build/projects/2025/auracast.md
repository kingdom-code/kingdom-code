Imagine having the sermon audio delivered directly to your earbuds or hearing aids, or receiving clear announcements even in a noisy church foyer. This is the promise of Auracast — an emerging Bluetooth 5.4 technology that promises to transform accessibility.

The Auracast Pathfinders want to ensure Christian communities are ready to embrace this technology, using it to create more inclusive, accessible worship experiences.

At BUILD, the team wants to explore building an open-source Auracast Toolkit specifically designed for Christian contexts. This isn't just about better sound systems — it's about removing barriers to participation and creating new opportunities for connection.

During the weekend the team want to explore:

- Building an "Auracast Assistant" app to tune in to the Auracast feeds in a church service
- Exploring a tool that will allow broadcasting from a church's sound desk
- Creating setup guides tailored for church environments

Whether it's providing seamless translation services, clear announcements in noisy environments, or welcoming messages for outdoor events, Auracast could revolutionize how churches serve their communities with audio.

This project is research and development — an opportunity to get hands-on with cutting-edge technology and imagine how it could serve the kingdom. The team will provide technical support and explore what's possible when Bluetooth audio meets Christian innovation.
