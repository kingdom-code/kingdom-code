Christians Against Poverty are back at BUILD! Their debt help service empowers churches across the UK to provide practical help to people in financial crisis, walking alongside them with the hope and love of Christ.

When they moved to their new CRM platform, clients lost the ability to submit their own documentation — something they could do easily before. Now there is a manual process, creating bottlenecks and reducing client autonomy.

CAP wants to explore a browser-based solution that allows clients to identify themselves, upload their paperwork, and attach it directly to their case. With AI guidance and OCR technology, clients could submit documents independently while the system captures key data points.

At BUILD, the team will focus on:

- Building secure client identification processes
- Developing document upload capabilities (photos, PDFs)
- Implementing AI/OCR to guide users and extract critical data
- Creating seamless CRM integration for automatic case attachment

This isn't just about efficiency — it's about empowering people in financial crisis while freeing up debt advisors to focus on the personal support and gospel opportunities that make CAP's work so transformative.

The goal is to build something that sets CAP on the path toward a production solution, immediately serving their debt centres and supporting their broader platform modernization.
