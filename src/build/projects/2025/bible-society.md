Most Bible apps only let you share one verse or passage at a time, but pastors, missionaries, prayer partners, and small group leaders often want to share collections of related passages that work together to address a topic or need.

That's where the idea of _Bible Playlist_ comes in: a simple web tool that works like Linktree but for Bible passages. Users can create curated playlists of verses and passages, then share them easily via email, social media, or direct links.

The possibilities are endless:

- A pastor preparing their congregation for a difficult season might share passages about God's faithfulness during trials.
- A missionary could create playlists for new believers covering foundational truths.
- Small group leaders might curate verses for an upcoming study series
- Medical chaplains could share passages that bring comfort to those facing chronic illness.
- You could pick and share a couple of verses to share to encourage a friend

At BUILD, the team wants to create the first prototype; pulling a set of verses from [API.bible](https://scripture.api.bible/), grouping them together, and then creating a shareable link that can be pasted into any social media service. But there is so much more that could be done over the weekend!

After BUILD, Kirill Popov from Bible Society will adopt the prototype and develop it further, either as a standalone tool, integrated into Bible Society's online Bible app currently in redevelopment, or included within the BibleBolt plugin.

- **Skills needed:** Development, Design, UX/UI
- **Tech stack:** Open to team preferences (Bible Society internally uses ReactJS and PHP Laravel)
