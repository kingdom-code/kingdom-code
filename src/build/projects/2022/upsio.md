Upsio is Charity Software designed for Foodbanks and small community charities, to streamline the operations of organisations taking referrals, maintaining client records and stock control on a single web based platform.

Developed as a ‘passion project’, the idea for Upsio is to provide professional, easy-to-use tools to equip the diverse requirements of small, predominantly volunteer teams. The MVP is being developed in partnership with Foodbank PLUS in Shrewsbury and aspires to also offer real-time stock levels and predict future stock levels.

This project is looking for a full team of people of designers, developers, project managers to help take the current prototype forwards and to build out the application to better support the needs of an on-the-ground food bank.
