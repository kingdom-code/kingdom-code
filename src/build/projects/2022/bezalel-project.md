Project Bezalel’s single goal is to see Jesus’s name honoured across the globe through visual arts. We are on a passionate journey to see the world using Bible in a graphic novel style that would help them engage with biblical stories and text better. We believe this graphic novel will be the first of its kind to narrate entire Bible with visuals supporting all scriptures unaltered.

During the hackathon we're looking to bringing visual content to life for users as a way for them to read the scriptures next to the content as well as make some notes in the form of prayers and reflections. They should be able to share that with their friends or the community of Project Bezalel.
