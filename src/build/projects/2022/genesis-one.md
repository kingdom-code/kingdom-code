summary: The "Let there be..." statements in Genesis 1 have a coding parallel with type definition. What if we made a Domain Specific Language that let us define types/classes that way?

Let's build an IDE extension that will take statements along the lines of "let there be X" and "let the X have Y" and automatically generate equivalent code for use in an actual project.

We'll build a Visual Studio extension with C# and the ability to produce C# or TypeScript code. Support for other languages & IDEs is dependent upon the knowledge of participants.

Bible Stories for Software Developers is a passion project that explores the intersection of the Bible and software development. This project has come from that.

This is an experiment to ask questions about comparing software and scripture:

- Does this change how we feel about either?
- What effect does this have on how we see the act of creation?
- Does it change how we feel about writing software as a creative act?
- Is this a helpful tool for creating code?
