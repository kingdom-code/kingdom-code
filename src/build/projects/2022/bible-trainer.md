Are you exciting about voice technology? Do you want to explore how it might integrate into an existing project? Joining the Bible Trainer team might be for you! At BUILD 2022 Bible Trainer want to explore how to use voice input to help people memorise scripture.

Back at BUILD 2019 they built an app in Ionic which allows people to pick verses, passages, even entire books of the Bible to memorise. This year they're coming back and they want to explore helping people to recite the passage they are memorising outloud and receive reminders and corrections where they get it wrong.

This project might be something that gets bolted into the existing Ionic app using the [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) or building out something more custom with Amazon Alexa.
