500k is a ministry dedicated to training and supporting indigenous church workers across Asia - the ambition to see 500,000 church workers trained and supported. They partner with local leaders, providing training and financial resources so that the gospel message can be preached and taught.
As the ministry has started up a range of different tools have been picked up and brought together to help support the ministry from Google Sheets, Looker, through to a bespoke application with SQL backend. Each of these tools serves a crucial role in the operations, however with data siloed in different spreadsheets or databases it is hard to get a holistic view of operations, hindering the ability to identify trends and make strategic decisions.
During the hackathon we're not going to be able to come up with a completely solved solution for this, however during the weekend we'll be able to explore how systems are currently working for 500k, begin to look at potential solutions, and implement prototypes for 500k to take away and test.
