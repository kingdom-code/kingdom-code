WhatsApp, Zoom, YouTube and Powerpoint are commonplace tools across the church, and all of these tools are being used to communicate Bible passages to their communities. But bringing the Bible into these tools can be clunky and tricky - cutting and pasting a Bible verse from websites like Bible Gateway brings with it the footnotes and verses, pasting into powerpoint can make the text too small to read.

Bible Society would like to see a new suite of plugins bring the Bible text into the chosen technology in an easy to use way. During the hackathon youâ€™ll have access to api.bible, which provides you an automated way to bring in Bible text on demand.

How would you help Bible Society resolve this cumbersome issue?
