Safe Families exists to create relationships and connection for young people and families as everyone deserves to be part of. They do this with and through the local church. Local authority partners (50+ now across the UK) refer families to us and Safe Families UK connects them with a volunteer from a local church. Volunteers connect with families around specific goals, but with the desire to bring the family into a wider sense of belonging within their local community. That may be a toddler group, church, meeting for coffee, or doing a practical project.

Getting the right match is key and subject to all manner of variables. During BUILD 2023 Safe Families is looking to explore improvements to the matching system. How might we better engage volunteers, speed up the process, and create the best match possible?

Would you consider exploring solutions that can be built to see matching improved to allow better connections?
