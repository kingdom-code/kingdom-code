year: 2023

As a mission organisation Greater European Missions are looking at better ways to understand and communicate the impact they are having in their mission field. They want to provide more visualisations which display how they are having an impact.

Obviously, impact can never be fully measured with numbers, but numbers can be part of the story (Acts 2:41). Currently this information is collected in story and numeric form. During the hackathon GEMeDot will be exploring a prototype that receives data in real time and shows graphs visualising differing time periods, tools being used, and possibly discipleship generations.

Would you consider helping GEMeDOT steward this data well, keeping the focus on where and how God is moving?
