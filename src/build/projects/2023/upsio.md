Upsio is a pioneering pre-production multi-tenant SaaS tailored to empower Foodbanks with cutting-edge digital tools, facilitating efficient scalability. Upsio addresses a pressing concern: Foodbanks nationwide are witnessing a significant surge in client numbers while experiencing a decline in donations. The Upsio platform offers streamlined processes and effective client management, empowering foodbank staff to allocate more time and attention to those in our society who are often the most vulnerable, enabling smoother operations and vital assistance.

Following a successful live trial in December 2022, Upsio garnered significant partnerships with industry leaders such as Scottish Power and Midcounties Coop. The trial demonstrated tangible impact, enabling Shrewsbury Foodbank to distribute an impressive 560 Christmas Hampers with the same resources that previously supported only 200.

Presently, Upsio is gearing up for another live trial this Autumn, laying the groundwork for onboarding two full-time beta food banks in the coming year.

Returning to BUILD this year as an award-winning project, Upsio carries ambitious aspirations. The development roadmap encompasses both the creation of new features and the enhancement of existing ones, necessitating technical expertise for seamless execution.

Upsio seeks assistance in several crucial areas:

- Duplicate Referral Handling: Leveraging PAF address data, Upsio can now identify if a residence is already registered in the system. However, the nuanced task of uniquely identifying individuals goes beyond their residential address.
Backend Policies: Implementation of robust backend policies to ensure precise control over permissions, comprehensive logs, and restricted access.
- Inbound SMS Integration: Establishing a secure backend endpoint to receive inbound SMS, effectively log the messages and their respective states, and trigger push notifications to the relevant team members for swift responses.
- State-Based Routing: Facilitating a seamless browsing experience within Upsio based on 'service,' filtering all content by the selected service.
- Robust Search and Filtering Mechanism: Developing an efficient method for searching, filtering, and consuming content within the application.
- PWA Optimisation:
  - Efficient Caching: Optimise font caching and implement service workers for improved load times and offline functionality.
  - Idle State Performance: Enhance application responsiveness during idle states and enable seamless background sync for improved user experience.
