summary: How might we take some of the tools of an IDE and apply them to scripture?

We have a rich set of tools and features to help us navigate, understand, and highlight important parts of code, but, when it comes to scripture, at best, we only get hyperlinks, footnotes, and separate commentary. What if applied some of the tools and techniques we have for making code easier to read and understand to the Bible?

The goal for this weekend is to explore this idea. Break it down, explore possibilities, and create mockups, or possibly prototypes. This idea excites me, but I recognise that while it could be valuable it's also a potentially very large project to build. While it might be valuable, it may also only be a novelty. Or even nonsense. It's worth taking a weekend to prototype something to better communicate the vision and gather wider feedback.

What happens after BUILD depends on the feedback from the mockups. Maybe nothing, maybe prototypes, maybe a full on product. Whether the feedback is positive or negative, it will help towards my wider goal of helping people interested in code also be interested in the Bible.
