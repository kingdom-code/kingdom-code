summary: What technology could we implement to help non-english speakers understand a Sunday service in real-time?
year: 2023
---

At North Evington Free Church, there has been a growing number of non-English speakers join us on Sunday for worship which is a real privilege. But, it has been a challenge, though, to make the services accessible for those that don’t (yet) speak English. NEFC desires to see them involved but feels limited. How can technology help this church include our neighbours?

How can we provide real-time language translation to bridge language barriers? Throughout the hackathon could a prototype be built that could be trialled in a service and think about how that might be available for not just one church, but other churches in similar contexts.

How could you make church services accessible to people who don’t have English as a mother-tongue?
