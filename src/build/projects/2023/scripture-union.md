summary: How might create a hybrid space for young people to grow in their faith
year: 2023
---

For the last 18 months, Scripture Union England and Wales have been exploring what a hybrid model of mission could look like with children and young people across the UK. The focus has been to take the best bits of face-to-face and online mission and ministry in order to create a synergy between the two.

SU has a desire to enable a space where children and young people can explore the Bible, respond to Jesus, and grow in their faith in a way that is relevant and accessible to them. It’s a space where relationships and community are at the heart of the project and a commitment from Faith Guides—church workers and volunteers that belong to a local church—to journeying with children and young people through the realities of life. How might we give opportunities to explore what faith means in the midst of it? Most of our face-to-face missional contexts are limited to geography, but it would be interesting to see how an online/digital setting could transcend geography and explore different communities, whilst still being rooted in some expression of local church.

How would you explore the cross between digital and in-person outreach?
