Osi's first hackathon was BUILD 2022, and over the last year he has been working on his own passion project – Fellow. Fellow is a tool for Christians to be able to come and share their understanding on the word of God, and ask questions about their faith.

The groundwork for the project is already in place, but there are a few more areas that need to be worked out before it can start to be tested within a group of people from Osi's church who are ready for it. Key areas such as tightening up some of the UI and key interactions, implementing a the discussion and commenting system, etc.

Could you join Osi during BUILD 2023 so that his church family can start using this tool after the hackathon?
