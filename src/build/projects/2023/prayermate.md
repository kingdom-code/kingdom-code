PrayerMate is an app to help people manage their prayer lists. After a three week R&D project Discipleship Tech are preparing to migrate how the internal database of PrayerMate works to fix a number of longstanding bugs, and open up the doors for new potential functionality. This will involve moving a lot of code that was previously in the native layer into the new Flutter layer, and rewriting to work with PowerSync and Postgresql: whether that's data syncing, prayer session scheduling, downloading content from feeds, or any one of a number of other features.

If you have experience with Flutter and/or PowerSync, or backend/SysAdmin/PostgreSQL/Node.js skills, or are just generally willing to roll up your sleeves and get stuck into something meaty that will be used by tens of thousands of users every month, we'd love you to consider participating in our project at BUILD!
