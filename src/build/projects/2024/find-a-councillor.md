In the UK, 1 in 4 people face a mental health challenge every year, and chances are, you know one of them. At Waverley Abbey, we’re deeply committed to helping people step into their God-given purpose. Through our training in spiritual formation, mental health, wellbeing, and leadership, we’re equipping Christians to make a real difference in tackling the growing mental health crisis.

As one of Europe’s largest providers of Christian counselling qualifications, Waverley Abbey currently offers a basic and functional online directory of accredited Christian counsellors, for those seeking support. But in a world where apps like Uber and BetterHelp have made life simpler, what if we could revolutionise the way people connect with Christian counsellors? Imagine if, with just a few taps, someone in need could instantly find a professionally trained, accredited counsellor in a fast, seamless, and accessible way. How could this transform the future of mental health in our nation?
