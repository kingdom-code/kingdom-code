Counselling is a growing area as there is a greater awareness of mental health care, and more and more people seek to talk with trained counsellors. You might never have heard of Waverley Abbey, but they are one of the biggest trainers of Christians in counselling to the UK and Europe – their training programs meet the standards for accreditation with UK professional bodies.

Recently Waverley Abbey has published a very basic directory of counsellors, it works, but it is basic - it’s a list of names, locations, and contact details. In the age of Uber and BetterHelp, what would it look like for Waverley to make access to Christian counselling as quick as ordering an uber, and as accessible as BetterHelp?
