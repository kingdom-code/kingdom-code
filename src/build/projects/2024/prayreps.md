Christians currently struggle to place the love of Jesus at the heart of how they think and pray about politics - our cultures, and therefore our prayers, are more informed by fear and desire for control than by faith and desire to see God's Kingdom come in our communities and nations.

Pray for Elected Representatives (PrayReps) makes it easier for Christians to pray for those who exercise authority in their governments, at local and national level. It isn't about praying for policies or parties, but for places and for people, as a necessary - and often neglected - foundation for the church to care for the nations and pray for political leaders. Praying about policy is important, but it's not what PrayReps is for.

Arranged around electoral maps, and focused on praying specifically for each representative in each part of the polity, PrayReps is meant to be portable to any country having an election, and we want to build a robust and simple minimum viable product to enable Christians to pray through forthcoming elections, including in the United States, as well as for those newly elected to Parliaments since July (including the UK).

Over the course of the weekend can you help PrayReps go from a hacked together codebase running locally, to something that other people can join in with? Can you help them scale to accomodate more elections, handle more users, remember how far through a user has prayed, etc?
