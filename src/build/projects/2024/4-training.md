[4training.net](https://github.com/4training/app4training) provides discipleship training resources on following the example of Jesus in more than 40 languages. The worksheets have matured over years so that they're simple and clear to understand yet with high quality and focusing on practical application. They can be used side-by-side in different languages to help overcome language barriers in outreach and discipleship.

Everything is copyright-free (CC0) so that multiplication can happen: Disciples making disciples making disciples making disciplesâ€¦

There are three different areas 4training would love to explore at BUILD this year:

1) **Prototyping interactive features for the 4training app. (Dart + Flutter)**
Currently the app is just providing the resources offline. In the future we'd want ways how users can ask for help, give feedback, maybe introduce notes etc. but we're not sure what exactly would be helpful and where to go regarding UI - having some people brainstorming and prototyping would be awesome in getting clarity which direction to head with our next app development steps
2) **Develop a mobile-friendly skin for 4training (HTML + CSS)**
For the last 9 years the website has had the same design which is not even mobile-friendly. Having a team develop a new design / make the existing design mobile-friendly would be a huge step in making the website more usable.
3) **Improve our Python tools**
We have [python tools for various tasks](https://github.com/4training/pywikitools) in the background, for quality assurance and for glueing different components together. There's a number of open issues where it would be awesome if we can close some of them.
