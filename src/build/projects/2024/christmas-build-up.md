Faith in Kids wants to support parents and churches to work together to raise children who trust in Jesus eternally. This year they are releasing a new resource - [The Christmas Story Brick by Brick](https://www.faithinkids.org/the-christmas-story-brick-by-brick/).

The Christmas Build Up aims to be 24 manageable-moments for families to explore the Christmas story together during Advent. Each moment will include an activity/ mini bible devotional linked with “The Christmas Story Brick by Brick” book and The Lego Christmas video. Each week focuses on a different part of the Christmas story, beginning with a day of video, followed by four days of mini-bible study with a picture and simple questions, a day linking to the podcast and finally a more reflective day with a craft or activity to summarise the story of the week.

How might Faith in Kids bring this 24 day advent calendar to life on their website in a fun and accessible way for families? Visually it would need to be in line with the existing branding, but we think there is fun to be had with the Brick by Brick theme. Is each of our ‘moments’ a brick? Does it build a picture over time? Do we have digital doors that open like an advent calendar?

Some practical things to consider:

- We want this to be creative and engaging but we don’t want the novelty to get in the way of this being a simple tool to help families open the Bible this Christmas.  
- We anticipate having a week’s worth of material released at a time. We don’t want families to feel burdened/ tied to doing every day or that if they miss a day they are behind. Equally, we don’t want families to do it in one big batch - the purpose is to get them opening the Bible for a short moment each day. What mechanism can we use that gives this flexibility? 
- We want families to see the picture build / doors open over time, but what happens if they do it at a different pace from others? How would different families experience it?
