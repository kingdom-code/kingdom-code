The Prayer Walk App enables churches and organisations to set up prayer walk events, to cover an area in prayer. Users tap on roads to say they've been prayed for, and it will change colour. Others can explore all the roads on the main map. Submitted prayer needs allow for users to add prayers they want others to join them in praying.
There are many different improvements that would be great to explore at BUILD 2024 such as…

- It would be useful to have a list of churches for users to choose from rather than an open text field (to help their data since users might input the same church differently), the challenge is how do you provide a complete set of churches for users to choose from.
- Replacing the background video loop of the homescreen with something better (this may be stock footage put together, or something custom).
- It would also be great to show an organisation user the app as they're changing it, so they can see how their settings would affect the app in real time.

Behind the scenes PrayerWalk has a Java backend with Typescript building the app itself.
