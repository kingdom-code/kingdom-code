Bible Society is all about inviting people to discover the Bible’s message for themselves, even if they’ve never thought the Bible was for them. And one of the ways it does this is by resourcing Bible communicators. These Bible communicators might be pastors, or preachers, or evangelists, who take the Bible and share it with people.

WhatsApp, Zoom, YouTube and Powerpoint are commonplace tools for these Bible communicators. But bringing the Bible into these tools can be clunky and tricky - cutting and pasting a Bible verse from websites like Bible Gateway brings with it the footnotes and verses, pasting into powerpoint can make the text too small to read.

Last year at BUILD we developed BibleBolt for Google Docs - a simple bolt on to allow effortless inserting and formatting of verses – saving time, ensuring clean and consistent presentations, and making sure that words don’t get lost in the copy-and-paste.

This year, Bible Society is bringing BibleBolt back to BULID to explore what other bolt-ons could be developed - e.g. a bible plugin for Microsoft 365 (Word, Powerpoint), Canva, or OBS. Where could we bolt in the Bible?
