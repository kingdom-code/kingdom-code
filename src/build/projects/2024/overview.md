As part of our ongoing efforts to support discipleship, we are exploring the development of a Bible Overview App. This app will help participants in our Discipleship Groups engage with the entire story of the Bible in an accessible, user-friendly format.

The app will provide an overview of the Bible’s narrative, helping users grasp key themes and the overall arc of the biblical story. Our vision is to make this a tool that can be used by both individuals and groups, offering features like guided reading plans, interactive elements, and resources that facilitate deeper engagement.

This hackathon is the perfect opportunity to build a prototype using a cross-platform language such as Flutter or React Native. If the concept shows promise, we aim to continue development with the goal of launching the app publicly by Summer 2025.
