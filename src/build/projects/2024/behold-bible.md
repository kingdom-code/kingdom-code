Behold Bible is a Bible app with a desire to empower people in their engagement with God’s Word. It combines the elements of reading, memorizing, and note-taking within a single unified web-app, and seeks to make those activities less overwhelming, more engaging/enjoyable.

It also has an underlying aim to reflect the beauty and living nature of God’s Word through design elements such as typography, colour, spacing, etc. (There is some interesting overlap with the "Reading Scripture like Code" project from Build 2023; the app's UI takes inspiration from the UI of code editors / IDEs).

It is a passion project that developed from wanting to build a stronger relationship with God, grow in knowledge and consistency in engaging with the Bible, and help others do the same (while also being an opportunity to improve development and design skills).

At the hackathon, it would be great to work with a team to further develop / polish up / test its current features and get input and direction on the current backend implementation, especially around CI/CD and security. The plan is to keep working on the project even after the event and eventually release a version of the app for public feedback/use.
