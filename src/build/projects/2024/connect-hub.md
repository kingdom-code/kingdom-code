summary: In the UK only 4% of young people have a meaningful relationship with a local church. If parents, Christian teachers, and local churches were able to start working together how might that change?
year: 2024

There has been a lot of research that has discovered that 90% of Christians come to faith before their 18th birthday… but in the UK only 4% of under 18s are connected to a church. In other words, the vast majority of people who are open to Christianity are not in a local church. Therefore, the way to engage with young people to introduce them to Jesus can no longer be in the church alone.

Christian teachers, Christian parents, parachurch organisations, and local churches are all part of the solution, but often these four groups just don’t know how to find each other. Cross Connecting wants to provide a platform to bring people together in a local area to explore how they can begin to share the gospel with young people together.

Over the weekend at BUILD Cross Connecting wants to explore how this platform could start, how it could facilitate communication, collaborations, and partnerships at the local level for those working with children and young people.
