At Stewardship, we empower Christians to support the causes they love—missionaries, churches, and charities—through the generosity of over 30,000 givers. However, true generosity goes beyond financial gifts. Many of our partners, especially individual support-raisers and small charities, need emotional and spiritual encouragement in their Kingdom work. We believe that fostering deeper relationships between givers and these partners is crucial to making this possible. 

In September, we launched Partner Profiles, giving our 12,500 partners the tools to create more compelling pages that invite support for their mission/ministry. **These profiles are personalized using an AI tool created at BUILD 2023, which automatically suggests relevant Cause Crosses to match their needs**. This innovation set the stage for deeper connections, but we know there’s more to unlock in terms of relational giving. 

At BUILD 2024, we invite you to help us rethink how Stewardship accounts can create stronger bonds between givers and the partners they support. We envision a solution that not only informs givers of the impact of their financial support but also allows them to engage with their partners in a holistic way—through prayer, encouragement, and personal updates. We aim to streamline the fragmented tools our partners currently use for communication, making it easier to build relationships in a digital space. 

The challenge is to design and/or build a platform that fosters a sense of fellowship between a partner and their team of supporters, making relational giving more natural. This could look like givers receiving real-time updates on their partners' needs, prayer requests, and progress, or giving to one-off needs as part of a digital conversation. Your contributions at BUILD 2024 could reshape how givers and support-raisers interact. Let’s build a future where generosity transcends transactions and becomes a meaningful, relational partnership in Kingdom work.
