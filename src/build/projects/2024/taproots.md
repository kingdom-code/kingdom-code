Taproots is an interactive, Bible-based game [inspired by the NYT's "Strands"](https://www.nytimes.com/games/strands).

The aim is to challenge players to make meaningful connections between various Bible passages, deepening their understanding while enjoying a fun and engaging puzzle experience. By applying their knowledge of Scripture, users will weave together verses to form thematic links, uncover relationships, and explore the Bible in a new way.

This project is ideal for quick prototyping in a hachkathon context. We're looking for a small team to come around the idea to develop a working version with a frontend framework such as React or Vue.

With its simple mechanics and straightforward design, Taproots could easily be built within a 24-hour timeframe.
