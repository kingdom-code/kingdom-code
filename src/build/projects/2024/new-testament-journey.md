year: 2024

Over the past few years Croydon Vineyard has developed a daily devotional that takes ordinary people through the whole of the New Testament over the course of a calendar year…

It’s grown and taken shape over years, beginning with a simple blog; then into a 'church collaborative reading project' where around 100 members of the church contributed to an audio recording of the New Testament; some branding and design work was done on it; then produced an audio podcast version and recently self published book version on Amazon. It has been very well received, and this year it has begun to be used by several other churches in the Vineyard UK network. 

New Testament Journey is a resource that keeps on growing. Devotional content delivered in apps have been so well received, such as Lectio 365 or Bible in One Year. Croydon Vineyard would love to explore at BUILD 2024 how New Testament Journey could be translated for a mobile app.
