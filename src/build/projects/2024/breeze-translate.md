Last year at BUILD a church in Leicester came with the challenge ‘How can we provide real-time language translation to bridge language barriers during church services?’ During the weekend a team came around the challenge and created [Breeze Translate](https://brzt.uk/).

There are now over 10 churches now using Breeze Translate, and there are lots of requests from other churches to start using too – they would love to scale it up to more. However, the current architecture at the moment requires spinning up individual instances of the project for each client, which requires time from the limited team. They would love to enable churches to get to try this more quickly — so it could be rolled out globally.

There are other areas that it would be great to explore at BUILD such as improving the onboarding experience, and streamline that process to bring Breeze Translate to more churches.
