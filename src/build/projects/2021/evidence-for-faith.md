This is an evangelistic apologetic tool based on the evidence for the resurrection which exposes honest seekers to Scripture and other evidence for faith.

The premise is that the resurrection is the most important verifiable historical event that has ever happened. It uses a statistical formula to give a 'probability', 'likelihood' or 'reasonableness' for the resurrection, and this value increases as the evidence for the resurrection and each new apologetic argument is accepted as reasonable.

It is currently in its first iteration; at BUILD 2022 we want to make it a much more immediate and relevant resource whilst continuing to use the statistical formula in the background.
