The Intercultural Hub is a new entity aiming to provide digital and physical integrated hubs for churches and networks to work together to help plant, strengthen and multiply intercultural churches, providing focused resources to build bridges and trusted relationships across a diversity of backgrounds. We pray that this will lead to groups of new believers, people from different backgrounds, gathering together to worship the Lord Jesus Christ, exalting Him above all else.

The specific part of the Hub of interest to the hackathon is the prototype of a fully remote intercultural training delivery platform able to integrate existing online & offline training provision from theological ministry institutions. Highly intuitive design and content delivery given a range of educational levels and language abilities. With in-app social interaction / collaboration to facilitate interaction in proposed physical space, and potential synergies to other services offered by the Hub (e.g. ministry and leadership development).
