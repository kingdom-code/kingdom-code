summary: The app helps organisations in cities or areas engage people in prayer walking and becoming passionate for the area they live in. At its simplest, it allows people to select streets to walk and then say when they've been prayed for. A map is shown to users to show the overall progress of covering an area in prayer.

Improving the design and UX - are there things which can be clearer and made easier for users? What kind of user research should be done? And then looking at how that research informs the app going forward.

Secondly how should the app design evolve to incorporate more features like showing distance walked/complete, previous walks and feedback.

Gathering prayer walking feedback - how can we gather feedback from people's praying to inform the organisation and church about what God is saying in an area?

Some churches might find it useful to put out information through the app about an area - e.g. encouragement to continue walking or notification about a group prayer walk.
