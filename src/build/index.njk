    challenge: 'How can we equip Christians to use the Bible more in evangelism?',
    intro: '"Go and make disciples of all nations...". These are the words of Jesus to his disciples (Matt 28v19). And Paul writes to Timothy "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching..." (2 Tim 3v16). So how might we use technology to equip Christians to use Scripture in their personal evangelism?',

The local church has a role to play in caring for the poor and vulnerable in its community- so how might we be part of resourcing that work of service?',
