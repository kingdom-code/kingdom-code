Join us in London as we share vision for FaithTech in the city and beyond!

Come meet, learn, and build with other like minded Christians in tech as we steward our skills for the glory of God together!

We'll hear from the CEO and Founder of FaithTech, James Kelly, James Doc, Co-Leader of Kingdom Code, and Kevin Burgess, Global Communities Director from FaithTech, who will unpack a vision for FaithTech in London, to see us awakened to a Jesus revival in and through tech.

Earlier this year FaithTech launched a community in Sheffield, and we're exploring what it might look like to launch a FaithTech community in London. We'll share more about the vision behind FaithTech, what that might look like in London, and how we can be praying for the season ahead together.

Over the last seven years there has been great and friendship between FaithTech and Kingdom Code, so together we're really excited to share about how this might come together. Come and be a part of the conversation!
