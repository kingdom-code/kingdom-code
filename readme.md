# Kingdom Code

## Editing the events

Events are stored in `src/_data/events.json`

Add new events at the top in the format:

```
  {
    "name": "Meetup",
    "date": "2018-10-18",
    "url": "https://eventbrite.com/â€¦",
    "description": "This is an event description"
  },
```

## Development

To get this up and running on your own computer you need to have Node and NPM installed. [Find out how here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

Once you have installed NPM in the command line run the following line in this folder:

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

You'll now have a local server running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

This is built on top of [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io) because it is great. One of the nice things about 11ty is it's [super simple documentation](https://www.11ty.io/docs/).

## Deploy

`npm run build`
